Indian Cloud Services is an on demand cloud computing and file storage service. We aim to make it easier for the users to manage their files online by having a clean and simple interface. We focus on privacy and security so that our users do not have to worry about their data.
We have implemented our service by creating a website where a user can upload his file with a click of button. His files will then be available to him 24/7 online for him to work upon. A new user needs to sign up the first time. Thereafter he can just login and he will be good to go.
